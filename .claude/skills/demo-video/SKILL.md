# Demo video

Create a watchable demonstration of each executable application: real execution,
spoken narration, readable captions, and verified outcomes. The default is one
continuous successful take at 1280 × 720, roughly two to five minutes per
application, with a synthesized voice track. Narration is mandatory: a video
without an audible narration track is not a finished demo. Adjust length to
useful workflow coverage rather than padding or rushing it. Honor a user's
requested applications, format, and presentation overrides.

Resolve supporting references relative to this installed skill folder; resolve
application files and `docs/demo/` relative to the consuming repository.

## 1. Understand the repository and identify applications

Read applicable agent instructions, README files, workspace/project manifests,
entrypoints, startup scripts, tests, and existing demo tooling. Read useful content
under `docs/specs/` and `docs/detailed-designs/` when present. Neither directory is
required: infer behavior from source, tests, and runtime inspection when absent.
If documents disagree with the implementation, demonstrate what actually works
and record the discrepancy; do not claim unimplemented requirements.

Inventory every executable application before selecting scenes. Record its
purpose, audience, entrypoint, run command, local endpoint or interaction surface,
dependencies, authentication, and candidate workflows. Count independently
runnable first-party APIs and workers even when a web app also depends on them.
Separate user-facing apps served by one host still deserve separate videos.
Exclude libraries, migrations, test runners, repository maintenance scripts, and third-party
infrastructure unless the user explicitly wants to demonstrate those tools.

Assign stable lowercase hyphenated slugs, preserving established demo names.
Disambiguate duplicate names with their subsystem. Account for every application
as recorded, blocked with a reason, or excluded by the user's scope. A repository
with no executable applications needs an explanation, not an invented demo.

## 2. Choose workflows and the recording method

Build a short storyboard per application: purpose, starting state, actions,
observable assertions, narration, and a useful final state. Write the narration
as short spoken paragraphs, one per opening card, chapter, or step, in second
person and plain language; the same text becomes the on-screen captions. Prefer
complete user journeys over touring every route or endpoint. Include meaningful
validation or permission behavior when it explains the product. Avoid exposing credentials,
private records, tokens, or sensitive shell history in footage and diagnostics.

Reuse existing acceptance helpers and demo conventions when suitable. Select the
capture method from available tools and the application's real interaction surface:

- Browser UI: read [browser recording](references/browser-recording.md).
- CLI, API, worker, or native UI: read
  [terminal and native recording](references/terminal-native-recording.md).

If apps share data, order their stories by dependency and reuse deterministic
synthetic fixtures. Explain which earlier recording establishes later state.
Provide a command that reproduces the whole sequence from a clean environment;
an individual rerun must prepare its prerequisites or name the required sequence.

## 3. Prepare a reproducible local run

Verify the required runtimes, locked dependencies, capture tools, database,
configuration, and local credentials, plus the narration tools: Python with the
`edge-tts` package, internet access for synthesis, and ffmpeg with ffprobe,
libopus, and libvpx. Prefer repository setup/build scripts.
Use normal authorized local setup to resolve missing dependencies; if credentials,
platform support, or external access remain unavailable, report exactly what is
needed and continue independent applications.

Use disposable demo storage and synthetic identities. Before any reset or cleanup,
verify the resolved database, directory, or container belongs to this run. Never
inherit a reset-on-start setting against an existing development database. Do not
reuse a listening server unless its identity, configuration, and data isolation
are established; otherwise choose unused ports. Bind demo-only services locally.

Use real application services and persistence where the application requires them.
Existing local adapters for mail, payments, AI, or other external integrations are
acceptable when disclosed. Do not substitute mocked product responses or remove
authentication to make the demo pass. Avoid actual external sends or purchases
without authorization already covering them.

Create application-specific recording scripts in the repository's existing test
or script structure. Keep recordings separate from the ordinary acceptance run
and its commit gates. Give startup, individual actions, the whole take, and
teardown finite timeouts. Check readiness before recording; do not fill the video
with build logs or server startup waits.

Track owned processes and resources from their creation. Enclose startup as well
as recording in cleanup handling so partial setup failures also clean up. On
Windows, launch background helpers hidden. Stop only owned processes, restore
changed environment settings, and report any cleanup failures and resources left.
Keep temporary video, trace, credentials, and logs in an ignored run directory.

## 4. Synthesize the narration

Synthesize the voice track with the free `edge-tts` Python package (Microsoft
Edge online read-aloud; no API key, Azure subscription, or paid Speech service).
Install it with `python -m pip install edge-tts` using the interpreter named by
`PYTHON`, and check connectivity with `python -m edge_tts --list-voices`. Use
the same voices as the video-creator skill: `en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural`
for the narrator and `en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural` for a second speaker such as
a labelled customer or administrator; `EDGE_VOICE` and `EDGE_VOICE_2` override
them. Use one voice set across every application in the same demo index.

Keep the narration text in a per-application `<app-slug>-narration.md` whose
paragraphs appear in capture order, each tagged with the chapter or step it
belongs to. Edge does not support custom SSML, so keep acronyms and code
identifiers in a `pronunciations.json` lexicon of plain-text spoken replacements,
apply it before synthesis, and spot-check difficult entries. Captions keep the
written form; the voice track uses the spoken form.

Synthesize before recording, one clip per paragraph, into the ignored run
directory. Normalize the clips to a common format, measure each with ffprobe,
and make every presentation hold at least as long as its clip plus a short
margin so the narrator finishes before the next action. During capture, log the
timestamp at which each paragraph's caption appears. After the video finalizes,
place each clip at its logged time, corrected by the same offset used for the
chapter times, pad the gaps with silence, loudness-normalize the result, and mux
it into the WebM as an Opus track with ffmpeg without re-encoding the video.
The video stream, its duration, and the chapter times must not change.

If Python, `edge-tts`, internet access, or ffmpeg is unavailable, that is an
actionable blocker for narration: keep the recording and its narration text in
staging, state exactly which commands remain, and do not promote or describe a
silent video as a completed demo. Never substitute silence, a text transcript,
or synthetic placeholder audio for the narration.

## 5. Record and verify

Use readable pacing, a brief opening, chapter transitions, and captions explaining
the user's outcome. Keep captions clear of the controls or output being shown.
Presentation delays are for listening and reading; readiness must use observable
conditions. Assert actual results before narrating that they succeeded:
persisted state, calculated values, loaded media, returned responses, or
completed jobs.

Record one continuous successful take per application. For browser capture, keep
the main story in one recorded page. Multiple actors may switch authenticated
sessions within that story without exposing secrets. Do not splice failed scenes
into a successful recording. Disable automatic retries; diagnose a failed take
and re-record it in full after a justified harness or setup correction.

Fix local setup and recording-harness problems within the request. Product bugs
are outside this skill's default repair scope: capture the failing step and
expected versus actual behavior, mark the affected demo blocked, and finish
independent apps. Do not repeatedly retry unchanged failures or weaken assertions.
User authorization for product repairs can expand that scope explicitly.

After capture has finalized and the narration is muxed, open and inspect the
encoded WebM itself. Check playback, measured duration and dimensions, beginning
and ending, each chapter, caption readability, and important visual outcomes.
Confirm with ffprobe that the file has one video stream and one Opus audio
stream of the same duration, then play the start of each chapter and verify the
spoken paragraph matches its caption and begins within about a second of the
action it describes. Sample frames are useful but do not replace playback
review for pacing. Verify media really loaded; an image's URL or alt text alone
is not evidence. Derive chapter times from the recording
timeline, verify them against playback, and choose a representative poster from
the successful footage. A nonempty file is not sufficient validation.

## 6. Deliver artifacts and rerun instructions

Stage each application's video, poster, narration text, and chapter metadata
outside final paths.
Promote the verified set only after its assertions and video review pass. Back up
existing files and restore them if promotion fails; do not mix an old video with
new chapter times or a new poster. Preserve unrelated demos and manual README
content. If a rerun fails, distinguish any retained prior video from this run.

Default deliverables in the consuming repository:

```text
docs/demo/
├── README.md
├── pronunciations.json
├── <app-slug>.webm
├── <app-slug>-poster.png
└── <app-slug>-narration.md
```

Repeat the video, poster, and narration files for every application. Synthesized
clips and the assembled audio track stay in the ignored run directory; the
narration text and lexicon are the reproducible sources. The README must include:

- An application inventory with links, purpose, and recorded/blocked status.
- Measured video duration, dimensions, file size, audio codec, narrator voices,
  and linked poster and narration text per recording.
- Chapter timestamps and the verified workflows they demonstrate.
- Exact setup and rerun commands, working directories, tool prerequisites,
  configuration variable names, data preparation, and cleanup behavior.
- Recording order, relevant source/test links and revision when available,
  integration substitutions, product limitations, and actionable blockers.

Record the actual commands, not an assumed universal `npm run demo`. Keep secrets
out of documentation. Include reproducible recording sources, but keep transient
logs and failure artifacts out of the deliverable set. Report completion only
when every in-scope application has a reviewed video; otherwise report partial
completion with explicit blockers and links to the successful artifacts.
